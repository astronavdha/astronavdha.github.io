In the memory of my dear Grandpa, *The Temple*.<br><br>

“Will you come?”, he would ask me - my Grandpa,<br>
every Tuesday, every Saturday,<br>
“It’s Lord Hanuman’s day,” he would say,<br>
“And you were born on a Saturday.”<br>
Defiant and unruly and willful as I was,<br>
I would nod in a game of pretend, <br>
submit only at the pact of shoulder rides,<br>
for it was on reason that my head ever did depend<br>
(and the Temple didn’t have quite)<br>
I would acquiesce, and slyly twinkle<br>
dreaming of ice-cream on the way back,<br>
my agreement masked in an exultant jingle.<br><br>

Even with my questionable faith firm and unyielding,<br>
the Temple always did welcome with obscure delight,<br>
the priest’s wife would sit in a sunlit corner,<br>
greet Grandpa, and would modestly smile at the sight<br>
of my sharp nose sincerely seeking, in hopes plain,<br>
relishing the blessed fragrance of burning incense,<br>
as my toes played in the patterns on the floor,<br>
my fingers on the bright yellow walls in a peculiar pretense.<br><br>

I wonder if she took the notice, and I think she did,<br>
of my enigmatic leaning towards marigolds <br>
over roses, for she did always place one, perhaps a<br>
supplementary luxury, on my skirt’s soft folds.<br><br>

After uncountable smiles exchanged, <br>
I still visit the temple, alone at ease,<br>
or pass by, for it was on a Tuesday that<br>
Grandpa died, and the woman is still there—<br>
the priest’s widow - and I can only bend my knees, <br>
in righteous regard or in rusty reliance,<br>
or perhaps out of forbidding fear, <br>
before Him, and still, remember to smile,<br>
all the same, a faded smile withal I hold dear,<br>
and I can only wonder, how long <br>
before she fades away along<br>
into a dull beige like the Temple’s walls,<br>
or jaded life, like Granny’s unvoiced calls<br>
for a peaceful death, a death like Grandpa’s,<br>
for he breathed his last on a Tuesday, <br>
and I, my first, on a Saturday,<br>
and so I will smile, and smile 'til the close, be it in vain;<br>
as in the pages of my diaries, among unfaded memories:<br>
it is only the faded petals of a marigold that remain.
