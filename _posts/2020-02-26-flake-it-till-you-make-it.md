This is a collection of books and stories that I will probably remember for a long time, each with a short description on what stood out to me in particular. Some of these are truly dear to me, and have changed how I view the world and who I am as a person.

        <h3><strong>Classical Electrodynamics</strong> by J.D. Jackson</h3>
        <p>It'd be a shame if I forget this.</p>

        <h3><strong>To Kill a Mockingbird</strong> by Harper Lee</h3>
        <p>A spiritual journey of self-discovery. I loved how it portrays the search for enlightenment as deeply personal.</p>

        <h3><strong>The History Boys</strong> by Alan Bennett</h3>

        <h3><strong>Dear Fatty</strong> by Dawn French</h3>
        <p>Not just dystopia, but a deep commentary on control and truth. I think about "doublethink" way too often.</p>

        <h3><strong>The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari</strong> by Robin Sharma</h3>
        <p>... as a reminder to never pick a self-help book ever again. The first and the last book of its kind that I read.</p>
