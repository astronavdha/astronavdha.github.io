This is a collection of books that I will probably remember for a long time, each with a short description on what stood out to me in particular. Some of these are truly dear to me, and have changed how I view the world and who I am as a person.

        <h3><strong>Spacetime and Geometry by Sean Carroll</h3>
        <p>Ahem. Cannot afford to forget this book, but slightly unfair since I haven't exactly read it from start to finish. </p>

        <h3><strong>Siddhartha</strong> by Hermann Hesse</h3>
        <p>A spiritual journey of self-discovery. I loved how it portrays the search for enlightenment as deeply personal.</p>

    <div class="carousel-item">
      <div class="text-center p-4">
        <h3><strong>The Bell Jar</strong> by Sylvia Plath</h3>
        <p>A raw and honest portrayal of mental health. It made me feel seen during a difficult time.</p>
      </div>

    <div class="carousel-item">
      <div class="text-center p-4">
        <h3><strong>1984</strong> by George Orwell</h3>
        <p>Not just dystopia, but a deep commentary on control and truth. I think about "doublethink" way too often.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="carousel-item">
      <div class="text-center p-4">
        <h3><strong>Norwegian Wood</strong> by Haruki Murakami</h3>
        <p>It's melancholic and beautiful. Murakamiâ€™s writing has a way of sitting with you quietly, like grief.</p>
