This is a compilation of books and stories that I will likely remember for a long time, each with a brief description of what stood out to me in particular.

  <div class="book-item my-4">
    <h3><strong>To Kill a Mockingbird</strong> by Harper Lee</h3>
    <p>I'm guilty of having imagined that the book was about a bird for the longest time. It is a classic for a reason - a light-hearted, somewhat funny narration to a dark sequence of events. I didn't realize until much later that the entire story from the beginning to the end is Scout (the narrator, six years old) recalling a time she got a fracture. " 'When they finally saw him, why he hadnâ€™t done any of those things . . . Atticus, he was real nice. . . .' His hands were under my chin, pulling up the cover, tucking it around me. 'Most people are, Scout, when you finally see them.'" : I do not care however much Atticus is criticized for being an outright racist in the sequel, I hope to carry at least this philosophy of his with me to my grave.</p>

    <h3><strong>The History Boys</strong> by Alan Bennett</h3>
    <p>"History is a commentary on the various and continuing incapabilities of men. What is history? History is women following behind with the bucket."  
    <br>A bunch of charming British boys preparing for the Oxbridge entrance exam under two mentors with distinct approaches to education. A play with brilliant dialogue.</p>

    <h3><strong>Dear Fatty</strong> by Dawn French</h3>
    <p>I'm a little biased because I can read even the ingredients on the back of a shampoo bottle with keen interest in the form of a letter. 
    <br>If you've watched Harry Potter films, you might remember the portrait of the Fat Lady at the entrance of the Gryffindor common room. In the third movie, it's played by Dawn French, which has very little to do with the book, but I'm trying to build a connection with the audience here. Dear Fatty is an autobiography written in the form of letters to her friends, family, and acquaintances. She recollects major happenings in her life with a wit I've always admired in people.</p>

    <h3><strong>The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari</strong> by Robin Sharma</h3>
    <p>... as a reminder to never pick a self-help book ever again. The first and the last book of its kind that I read.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="book-item my-4">
    <h3><strong>Satyadas</strong> by Bimal Kar</h3>
    <p>In all honesty, I do not remember this book as well - I read it over nine years ago. Even when I pretend to speak on rational grounds, the setting of this short book seems to evoke memories that never existed. An old man with tousled hair shows up at the doorstep of a couple one rainy night. The road is deserted, the couple runs a failing grocery store, and the man, Satyadas, asks for food and shelter for one night. That's all I can recall.</p>

Some of the best books that I've read were the ones that I wasn't influenced into buying - back when you and I were not chronically online, a.k.a. the pre-COVID era. I remember buying at least five of the above by weight from the international book fair in Delhi. I've read an unhealthy amount of murder mysteries as well, but unfortunately, most of them have been easily forgettable. I find most of the thriller/mystery books to be extremely plot driven with the usual eccentric detective, the ineffectual police, etc. etc. I suspect these stimulate my brain in a way similar to most of the brainrot content these days, but in the end, as my friend says, "each genre has its brainrot slop", and there are exceptions. If at all you're interested, here's a very apt and hilarious review of Origin by Dan Brown - https://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/books/article/2116986/dan-browns-latest-fun-filled-adventure-despite-authors.
