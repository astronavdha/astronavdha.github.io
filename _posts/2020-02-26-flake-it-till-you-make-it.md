This is a compilation of books and stories that I will likely remember for a long time, each with a brief description of what stood out to me in particular.

        <h3><strong>Classical Electrodynamics</strong> by J.D. Jackson</h3>
        <p>It'd be a shame if I forget this.</p>

        <h3><strong>To Kill a Mockingbird</strong> by Harper Lee</h3>
        <p>I'm guilty of having imagined that the book was about a bird for the longest time. It is a classic for a reason - a light-hearted, somewhat funny narration to a dark sequence of events. I didn't realize until much later that the entire story from the beginning to the end is Scout (the narrator, six yr. old) telling the reader about a time when she got a fracture. “When they finally saw him, why he hadn’t done any of those things . . . Atticus, he was real nice. . . .” His hands were under my chin, pulling up the cover, tucking it around me. “Most people are, Scout, when you finally see them.” : I do not care however much Atticus is criticized for being an outright racist in the sequel, I hope to carry at least this philosophy of his with me to my grave. </p>

        <h3><strong>The History Boys</strong> by Alan Bennett</h3>
        <p>"History is a commentary on the various and continuing incapabilities of men. What is history? History is women following behind with the bucket." A bunch of charming British boys preparing for the Oxbridge entrance exam under the guidance of two mentors with very distinct approaches towards education. The plot is carried by their exam and their sexualities. A play with brilliant dialogue, the film is just as good.</p>

        <h3><strong>Dear Fatty</strong> by Dawn French</h3>
        <p>I'm a little biased because I can read anything written in the form of a letter with deep interest, even the ingredients on the back of a shampoo bottle. If you've watched Harry Potter films, you might remember the portrait of the Fat Lady at the entrance of the Gryffindor common room. In the third movie, it's played by Dawn French, which has very little to do with the book, but I'm trying to build a connection with the audience here. Dear Fatty is an autobiography of the author, written in the form of letters to her friends, family, and acquaintances. She recollects major happenings in her life with a wit that I've always admired in people.</p>

        <h3><strong>The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari</strong> by Robin Sharma</h3>
        <p>... as a reminder to never pick a self-help book ever again. The first and the last book of its kind that I read.</p>

        <h3><strong>Satyadas</strong> by Bimal Kar</h3>
        <p>In all honesty, I do not remember this book as well as the others - I read it in the eighth grade, which was over nine years ago. As much as I pretend to say this on rational grounds, the setting of this short book seems to bring back memories that do not exist. An old man with tousled hair shows up at the doorstep of a couple one rainy night. The road is deserted, the couple runs a failing grocery store, and the man, Satyadas, asks for food and shelter for one night. This is all I can recall from my memory.  </p>

Some of the best books that I've read were the ones that I wasn't influenced into buying - back when you and I were not chronically online, a.k.a. the pre-Covid era. I remember buying at least five of the above by weight from the intl. book fair in Delhi. I've read an unhealthy amount of murder mysteries as well, but unfortunately, most of them have been easily forgettable, at least to me. I probably remember And Then There Were None better than the others because I watched the movie, but I find most of the thriller/mystery books to be extremely plot driven with the usual eccentric detective, the ineffectual police, etc. etc. I suspect these stimulate my brain in a way similar to most of the brainrot content these days, but in the end, as my friend says, "each genre has its brainrot slop", and there are exceptions (which I would like to be recommended). I personally would recommend them if you're looking for a relatively easier read, or are coming out of a readers' block (is that a thing?). 
This is one of the main reasons why I read all of the Dan Brown that I did. After the very first book (Angels and Demons), he became easily predictable in spite of all the plot twists that his books are known for. If at all you're interested, here's a very apt and hilarious review of Origin - https://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/books/article/2116986/dan-browns-latest-fun-filled-adventure-despite-authors. In other words, having read almost all his books, I can say I'm not a fan.

You might probably be wondering why I've read the Twilight series. Well, I was fifteen and in my defence, I never actively searched for these books. My mum got me Twilight from her school library, without reading the back of the book I'm positive. When I would be reading the book so intently, that too during my melancholic JEE days, I would only reply "Vampires" to my parents' questions as to what the book was about that I was so interested (I was only fifteen). The old version of the book with "apple in palms" cover saved me, for Robert and Kristen on the cover page would have given it away. I've for long wondered why would a state government school in India would carry the Twilight series, but I guess I'll never know. The books were great at the time, but the guilt of having enjoyed them even greater.
