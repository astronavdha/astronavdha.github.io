This is a collection of books and stories that I will probably remember for a long time, each with a short description on what stood out to me in particular. Some of these are truly dear to me, and have changed how I view the world and who I am as a person.

        <h3><strong>Classical Electrodynamics</strong> by J.D. Jackson</h3>
        <p>It'd be a shame if I forget this.</p>

        <h3><strong>To Kill a Mockingbird</strong> by Harper Lee</h3>
        <p>I'm guilty of having imagined that the book was about a bird for the longest time. It is a classic for a reason. A light-hearted, somewhat funny narration to a dark sequence of events. I didn't realize until much later when I read online somewhere that the entire story from the beginning to the end is Scout (the protagonist, six yr. old) telling the reader about a time when she got a fracture. “When they finally saw him, why he hadn’t done any of those things . . . Atticus, he was real nice. . . .” His hands were under my chin, pulling up the cover, tucking it around me. “Most people are, Scout, when you finally see them.” I do not care however much Atticus is criticized for being an outirght racist in the sequel, I hope to carry at least this philosophy of his with me to my grave. </p>

        <h3><strong>The History Boys</strong> by Alan Bennett</h3>
        <p>A raw and honest portrayal of mental health. It made me feel seen during a difficult time.</p>

        <h3><strong>Dear Fatty</strong> by Dawn French</h3>
        <p>Not just dystopia, but a deep commentary on control and truth. I think about "doublethink" way too often.</p>

        <h3><strong>The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari</strong> by Robin Sharma</h3>
        <p>... as a reminder to never pick a self-help book ever again. The first and the last book of its kind that I read.</p>
