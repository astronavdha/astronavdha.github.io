This is a collection of books and stories that I will probably remember for a long time, each with a short description on what stood out to me in particular. Some of these are truly dear to me, and have changed how I view the world and who I am as a person.

        <h3><strong>Classical Electrodynamics</strong> by J.D. Jackson</h3>
        <p>It'd be a shame if I forget this.</p>

        <h3><strong>To Kill a Mockingbird</strong> by Harper Lee</h3>
        <p>I'm guilty of having imagined that the book was about a bird for the longest time. It is a classic for a reason - a light-hearted, somewhat funny narration to a dark sequence of events. I didn't realize until much later that the entire story from the beginning to the end is Scout (the narrator, six yr. old) telling the reader about a time when she got a fracture. “When they finally saw him, why he hadn’t done any of those things . . . Atticus, he was real nice. . . .” His hands were under my chin, pulling up the cover, tucking it around me. “Most people are, Scout, when you finally see them.” : I do not care however much Atticus is criticized for being an outirght racist in the sequel, I hope to carry at least this philosophy of his with me to my grave. </p>

        <h3><strong>Dear Fatty</strong> by Dawn French</h3>
        <p>Not just dystopia, but a deep commentary on control and truth. I think about "doublethink" way too often.</p>

        <p>... as a reminder to never pick a self-help book ever again. The first and the last book of its kind that I read.</p>

Some of the best books that I've read were the ones that I wasn't influenced into buying - back when you and I were not chronically online, a.k.a. the pre-Covid era. I remember buying at least five of the above by weight from the intl. book fair in Delhi. I've read an unhealthy amount of murder mysteries as well, but unfortunately, most of them have been easily forgettable, at least to me. I probably remember And Then There Were None better than the others because I watched the movie, but I find most of the thriller/mystery books to be extremely plot driven with the usual eccentric detective, the ineffectual police, etc. etc. I suspect these stimulate my brain in a way similar to most of the brainrot content these days, but in the end, as my friend says, "each genre has its brainrot slop", and there are exceptions (which I would like to be recommended). I personally would recommend them if you're looking for a relatively easier read, or are coming out of a readers' block (is that a thing?). 
This is one of the main reasons why I read all of the Dan Brown that I did. After the very first book (Angels and Demons), he became easily predictable in spite of all the plot twists that his books are known for. If at all you're interested, here's a very apt and hilarious review of Origin - https://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/books/article/2116986/dan-browns-latest-fun-filled-adventure-despite-authors. In other words, having read almost all his books, I can say I'm not a fan.
