Hello! I am Navdha, a recent Physics graduate from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, located in the coastal city of Mumbai. I'm from a town called Shastri Nagar (SN) near the Ashok Vihar (AV) area of Delhi. My hometown is known for a lot of... interesting things, including but not limited to: sock factories and markets (SN), air pollution (Delhi; and on most days, AV in particular), and (to me) the most importantly, some of the best Chhole Bhature in the country. I like to read and write, but academic writing has taken up most of my said writing time over the past four years. I also sing sometimes - my showerhead is very impressed. <br>

The awkward name of this site originates from a time when I was a starry-eyed freshman (pun intended) and did not know the sheer amount of sitting in front of a screen that astrophysics research requires. Also I had already used my better GitHub username to build a personal website which I couldn't bring myself to fix due to a million HTML errors. <br>

I update this when I'm overwhelmed by my many shortcomings as a researcher (I'm joking) and want to trick myself into feeling productive. <br>

The views and opinions on this website (such as that of the most fascinating physical phenomenon being Bremsstrahlung) are entirely my own and, despite my (sporadic) efforts, may be erroneous. If you're a figure of authority and have landed on this page, I urge you to read the (sometimes slightly self-depreciating) material in the (possibly sleep-deprived) spirit in which it was intended.
