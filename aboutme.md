Hello! I am Navdha, a recent Physics graduate from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, located in the coastal city of Mumbai. I'm originally from a town called Shastri Nagar (SN) near the Ashok Vihar (AV) area of Delhi. My hometown is known for a lot of... interesting things, including but not limited to: sock factories and markets (SN), air pollution (Delhi; and on most days, AV in particular), being the national capital of India (Delhi) and (to me) the most importantly, some of the best Chhole Bhature in the country. I like to read and write, but academic writing has taken up the most of my said writing time over the past four years.
